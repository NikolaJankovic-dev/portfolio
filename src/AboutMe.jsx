            <div>Hello! My name is Nikola and I am a front-end developer. I started this journey in early 2021 and so far I learned html, css and javascript. React is my favorite tool. Sometimes I use bootstrap but it's more likely you'll see scss in my projects. Currently, I'm learning three.js. My journey just started, will you join me? Together we can reach the stars!</div>
